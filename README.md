# Automouse

This Python script moves the mouse cursor at regular intervals to random positions within a specified range.

## Usage

Install the required modules using pip with your terminal.

    ```
    pip install pyautogui
    pip install time
    ```

Run the script by executing 
    ```

The script will start moving the mouse cursor to random positions within a range of +/- 10 pixels around the current mouse position every 5 seconds.

Stop the script pressing Ctrl + C in the terminal. Enjoy!
